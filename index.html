								<p>Hello! I am Alonso, a computer science student currently attending the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.
									In high school, I joined the robotics team which sparked my passion for programming.</p>
								<p>I love programming robots and designing games. Being able to write a few lines of code on the computer and making an impact in the real world is something I find truly fascinating.
									Whether that is making a robot move and follow commands or making a game for others to enjoy. </p>
								<p>The unquantifiable amount of joy and happiness you feel when the robot you've been programming for months executes its task during a competition to score those winning points
									or when other students you don't know come in, asking to play your game is the reason I love programming. Knowing that in the end, a difference will be made and that justifies all the hard work and effort you put into it. </p>

							<!--Self Leveling Elevator-->
								<h2>Self Leveling Elevator</h2>
								<p>This was my first major programming project for a robotics competition. We competed in the First Robotics Competition, a internation high school
								competition where 2 alliances of 3 robots completed specific tasks to score points to beat the opposing alliance. The game that year was called
								Destination: Deep Space. You can view the trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/Mew6G_og-PI" target="_blank"> here</a> for more details on the game and their tasks. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/DeepSpacePlatform.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>  Above you can see the dimensions of the platforms the robot needed to climb. The problem was that the "legs" we used to climb wouldn't elevate
								at the same speed which could cause the robot to tip over. Below you can see a video of the initial climb test.  
								</p>
								<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EfdXeVlq_Rs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
								<p> The climb was too slow and awkward too control. To improve the elevator, I used a navX sensor that could detect the angle that the robot is at.
									I set a threshold that the robot can tilt at, if it went outside that boundary the corresponding leg would be slowed down to make sure the robot
									stays level. For example, if the sensor read -8 degrees that means it was leaning to far back and the front leg needed to be slowed down and vice versa.
									A video of the robot climbing during competition is shown below.
								</p>
								<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEeardrG1SE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
								<p>This system worked great in competition, helping us to win our very first ever regional. We tied 2nd for most points scored from climbing 
								with 198 points (1st place - 201 points) out of 40 teams. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/CentralILWinner.PNG" alt="" /></span>

							<!--Autonomous Routine-->
								<h2>Autonomous Routine</h2>
								<p>In the next season, the game was called Infinite Recharge. In this game you had to collect yellow balls called powercells and shoot them at a target called
								a port. The trailer can be viewed <a href="https://youtu.be/gmiYWTmFRVE" target="_blank"> here</a>.
								</p>
								<p> During the first 15 seconds of the game the robot is autonomous. We had two different routines for the robot depending on its starting position.
								 The purple route was for when we couldn't start at our ideal location but this routine can be done almost anywhere on the initiation line. In this routine
								 the robot would just shoot at the target and then moved forward off the line. The green route was for when the robot started in our ideal position. 
								 Here the robot would lock on to the port and rev up our turret to shoot the powercells. Then it would drive forward and collect 3 more powercells. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/InfRechargeMap.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p> In the competition, you earned 5 points for driving off the line. With these routines we would usually score 14-17 points out of a possible
								 23 points. When we did the green routine we had the added advantage of having 3 additional powercells ready to shoot when the teleop period of the game 
								 started. Here is a video showcasing the robot do the routines during competition.
								</p> 
								<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0kmHy8sdB4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
								<p> These routines were really consistent during matches. We ranked 3rd highest in points earned during autonomous out of 54 teams with a total of 376 
								 points (1st place - 399 points).
								</p>
							
							<!--Computer Vision Tracking-->
								<h2>Computer Vision Tracking</h2>
								<p>For the autonomous routine described above, I had to make a computer vision tracking system for the powercells in order for the robot to collect them.
								 The collecter system we had at the time worked best when the powercells were collected from the center of the robot. 
								</p>
								<p> The vision processing was not done in java or ran on the roboRIO, which is where the code ran on the robot. It was made in python and ran on a 
								 raspberry pi. The way I tracked the powercells was by filtering the video feed by creating a mask for the yellow color of the powercell. That way the robot only saw where the powercells were. After that,
								 I would have the robot target the largest blob detected, this would be the closest powercell to the robot. Based on where it saw the center of the powercell
								 it would turn the robot left or right to have the center of the powercell be in the center of the camera.
								</p>
								<p>Here is a video of the first camera test.</p>
								<p align="center"><iframe  width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjB4e_mH86k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
								<p> During competitions we needed a way to make sure the settings were all correct on the raspberry pi and that it was on. To do this, I made shells scripts
								that would download all the necessary software on to any raspberry pi, in case we had to change pis. I made another shell script that would change the camera
								settings that matched the ones from when the mask was created. Finally, I added a "heartbeat" the raspberry pi that would allow us to see if it was on
								from a laptop.
								</p>
								<p> This was a great project that also had use for future seasons. It also allowed me to gain experience in a new programming
								 language, python, and also learn about a new field of computer science, computer vision. 
								</p>

							<!--Flexible Finite State Machine-->
								<h2>Flexible Finite State Machine</h2>
								<p>Sadly in my last season on the robotics team, traditional competitions were canceled due to COVID. Instead, the competiton would be at home and
								 feature a lot of the same game pieces as the previous season. The new competiton format featured several different challenges where teams would then
								 upload videos of them completing the challenges and then be judged against other teams. 
								</p>
								<p> The challenge I wanted to do was called the AutoNav challenge. The robot has to autonomously go through 3 different paths, the barrel, slalom
								 and bounce path.  
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/BarrelPath.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SlalomPath.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/BouncePath.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>To be able to achieve this I broke down each key movement into a different state for the robot. We ended up making 5 different states,
								 circle, drive distance, drive distance with assist, idle, and turn to. With these 5 states we are to complete all the paths. Each of these states
								 were an extension of an abstract autoState class. I made an AutoFSM class that would handle an arraylist of autostates and iterate through all of them.
								 In order to navigate through the path, I had to list out all the steps and add them to this arraylist and then the robot would exectute them. 
								 I was able to create 3 different list and just feed the one I want to execute to the FSM and the robot would do it. 
								</p>
								<p>These are the videos we submitted to the judges.</p>
								<p align="center"><iframe  width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-ZmrNFTYcc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
								<p align="center"><iframe  width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YiUGLVexQk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
								<p align="center"><iframe  width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4_ftmRzmoA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
								<p> This is my proudest achievement in robotics. There were a lot of challenge due to COVID only being allowed for a couple hours in the building on certain days
								 but also this was a culmination of all my past knowledge and experiences including something new. It involved java, python, FSMs, computer vision, sensors, and 
								 abstraction which was something new to me at the time. I had so much joy and excitement when the robot completed the first path proving that it can be done.
								 A project I'll never forget.

							<!--Dont't Stop Moving-->
								<h2>Don't Stop Moving</h2>
								<p>Don't Stop Moving is the very first game I ever programmed. The premise of the game was that you are a test subject in an experimental facility.
									You have to escape the facility by collecting the fragments of a key while avoiding the facility's security measures. If you stop moving you die.
								</p>
								<p>Below is the trailer I made for the game.</p>
								<video class = "image main" controls>
									<source src="videos/Gaming1_DontStopMovingTrailer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								  Your browser does not support the video tag.
								</video>
								<p>Everything had to be created by yourself for this game, art assets, sound effects, and the code. I had 3 weeks to make the whole game.
									This project allowed me to apply the knowledge I have learned on the use of variables, functions, conditionals and classes in java. Also, used more 
									abstract concepts like finite state machines.
								</p>
						
							<!--ZPG-->
								<h2>ZPG</h2>
								<p>“Earth in the future has a competition to keep the population under control, 2 people compete against each other through several tests, 
									the competitor with the most victories, survives.”
								</p>
								<video class = "image main" controls>
									<source src="videos/ZPG_GameTrailer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								  Your browser does not support the video tag.
								</video>
								<p>That is the idea behind ZPG. The name is the acronym for Zero Growth Population. In this game you are competing against another player.
									There are 4 levels in this game. Each level tests a survival skill, speed, accuracy, resourcefulness, and defensive capabilities.  
								</p>
								<p>This game was more complex, incorporating arrays and arraylists combined with for loops to be able to organize and manipulate the data
									for the robots, targets and bullets. 
								</p>

							<!--Asteroids-->
								<h2>Asteroids</h2>
								<p>This is my recreation of the 1979 classic arcade game of the same name.</p>
								<video class = "image main" controls>
									<source src="videos/AsteroidsGameplay.mov" type="video/mp4">
								  Your browser does not support the video tag.
								</video>
								<p>Our assignment was to recreate a classic arcade game. I chose this game because it didn't use 4 way or 8 way movement.
									It used rotation and a value for speed to travel in that chosen angle.  
								</p>

								<p>While the gameplay is quite simple, I had to use some new techniques to make it happen. Angles and trigonemetry had to be used
									to set the speed on the x and y plane to the correct values to travel on the specified angle. It also had to be used for the targetting 
									of the alien spaceship that shoots at the player. This is also the first time I used velocity and acceleration to have the player
									ramp up to a speed instead of being set instantaneously. There is also momentum that keeps the player drifting in the direction they last
									moved in to simulate the near-frictionless vacuum of space. 
								</p>

							<!--AVALANCHE!-->
								<h2>AVALANCHE!</h2>
								<p>AVALANCHE! In this game you have to steer a tumbling snowball out of harm's way to the bottom of the mountain.</p>
								<video class = "image main" controls>
									<source src="videos/AvalancheGampleyCrop.mov" type="video/mp4">
								  Your browser does not support the video tag.
								</video>
								<p>This game was made for mobile devices. It uses the sensors in a phone to detect the tilt of it and that is used to control the snowball.
									It also uses the touch sensors to detect a tap to start the game and swipes for getting people out of the way of the snowball.
								</p>
								<p>The challenge of the game comes from the growing size of the snowball. Its grows larger the longer it rolls on for making it more difficult
									to manuever in between tents. 
								</p>
								<p> I had to implement and use a third party library, Ketai, for the sensors and touch detection. This game was also structured differently to my 
									previous games. I used switch cases to changed between levels instead of an if else chain. I also used inheritance to create more generalized 
									parent classes since the obstacles and levels child classes shared many data. It was more efficient requiring less lines of code than my previous
									method.

								<h3>Chef's Companion - Google HPS Speaker</h3>
								<p> I designed this speaker as a part of Google's Hardware Product Sprint program. In this 12 week program we had to design an enclosure
									for Google's AIY voice kit speaker. We came up with a problem that we wanted our speaker to solve and then design around that. 
								</p>
								<p> The problem I decided to solve with my speaker was not knowing what to cook. Many times, people just don't know what they want to make themselves
									to eat. The idea for this speaker was that when you press down on the top hat, it tells you a recipe to cook. We were only concerned with the 
									actual enclosure and not the functionality of the speaker. So I did not have to worry about it actually giving you a recipe. 
								</p>
								<p> Overall I am very happy with the design and aesthetic. It houses all the components of the AIY voice kit. The speaker was designed with plastic injection molding principles in mind so the design
									is mass manufacturable. I learned a lot of new skills especially since this is the first time I worked on an engineering project. I learned plastic
									injection molding design, tolerance analysis, design for manufacturability and design for assembly. All of these skills culminated in the creation
									of this beautiful speaker with an exquisite mustache.
